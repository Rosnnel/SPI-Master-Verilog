Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among hardware designers
and to provide a legal framework that supports the free use, study, modification,
and sharing of hardware designs and documentation.

The CERN-OHL-S is a strongly reciprocal licence that ensures that any distributed
modifications or derivatives of this design must remain open under the same terms.

1. Definitions

'Licence' means this CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal.

'Documentation' means schematic diagrams, HDL code (such as Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog),
PCB layouts, mechanical drawings, simulations, and any other information that
describes the hardware design.

'Product' means any device or physical object manufactured based on the Documentation.

'Licensee' means any person or legal entity exercising rights under this Licence.

2. Grant of Licence

CERN grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to use, copy,
study, modify, and distribute the Documentation, and to manufacture or distribute

If you breach the terms of this Licence, your rights under it will terminate automatically.
You may reinstate your rights by remedying the violation within 30 days of becoming
